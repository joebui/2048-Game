Please do not resize the game's window while playing as it will mess up the data of the game.

The program have some problem when runs in the 32-bit Debian virtual machine. However, it runs smoothly on the 32-bit Ubuntu and 64-bit Ubuntu. The problem in the Debian is that when the data of the struct is passed into the thread, some of them were messed up and we had no idea why this only occured in Debian.

Therefore, we suggest that you should test the program on 64-bit Xubuntu for best performance and accuracy. If it is not possible, we can bring our assignment to you for demo.
